# LAUNCH
Contains launch files for the TriPed-GUI.
Currently, only the robot visualisation uses this launch file.

In the future adding the Trip nodes for TriPed kinematics and addid a diagnostic aggregator for extended diagnostic functionalities might be a good idea.

## How to launch:
See the README in the triped_description folder.
